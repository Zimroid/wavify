# Wavify

Another project to learn React, convert a given picture to a pixelated copy that use sin waves instead of pixels.
(Inspired by the work of u/pidy90 https://www.reddit.com/user/pidy90/)

## How it's made

It's based on the same grid I created for my NervUI project.
Each cell contains a wave component which display a parametrable svg.
The parameters given to each wave component are computed from the picure given by the user.
